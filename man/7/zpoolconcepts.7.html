  Devices (vdevs)</a></h2>
A &quot;virtual device&quot; describes a single device or a collection of
  devices organized according to certain performance and fault characteristics.
  The following virtual devices are supported:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">disk</b></dt>
  <dd>A block device, typically located under
      <span class="Pa" title="Pa">/dev</span>. ZFS can use individual slices or
      partitions, though the recommended mode of operation is to use whole
      disks. A disk can be specified by a full path, or it can be a shorthand
      name (the relative portion of the path under
      <span class="Pa" title="Pa">/dev</span>). A whole disk can be specified by
      omitting the slice or partition designation. For example,
      <span class="Pa" title="Pa">sda</span> is equivalent to
      <span class="Pa" title="Pa">/dev/sda</span>. When given a whole disk, ZFS
      automatically labels the disk, if necessary.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">file</b></dt>
  <dd>A regular file. The use of files as a backing store is strongly
      discouraged. It is designed primarily for experimental purposes, as the
      fault tolerance of a file is only as good as the file system on which it
      resides. A file must be specified by a full path.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">mirror</b></dt>
  <dd>A mirror of two or more devices. Data is replicated in an identical
      fashion across all components of a mirror. A mirror with
      <i class="Em" title="Em">N</i> <span class="No">disks of size</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">X</i> <span class="No">can hold</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">X</i> <span class="No">bytes and can
      withstand</span> <i class="Em" title="Em">N-1</i> devices failing without
      losing data.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz</b>, <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz1</b>,
    <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz2</b>,
    <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz3</b></dt>
  <dd>A variation on RAID-5 that allows for better distribution of parity and
      eliminates the RAID-5 &#x201C;write hole&#x201D; (in which data and parity
      become inconsistent after a power loss). Data and parity is striped across
      all disks within a raidz group.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    A raidz group can have single, double, or triple parity, meaning that the
      raidz group can sustain one, two, or three failures, respectively, without
      losing any data. The <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz1</b> vdev type
      specifies a single-parity raidz group; the
      <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz2</b> vdev type specifies a double-parity
      raidz group; and the <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz3</b> vdev type
      specifies a triple-parity raidz group. The
      <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz</b> vdev type is an alias for
      <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz1</b>.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    A raidz group with <i class="Em" title="Em">N</i> <span class="No">disks of
      size</span> <i class="Em" title="Em">X</i> <span class="No">with</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">P</i> <span class="No">parity disks can hold
      approximately</span> <i class="Em" title="Em">(N-P)*X</i>
      <span class="No">bytes and can withstand</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">P</i> <span class="No">devices failing without
      losing data.</span> The minimum number of devices in a raidz group is one
      more than the number of parity disks. The recommended number is between 3
      and 9 to help increase performance.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid</b>, <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid1</b>,
    <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid2</b>,
    <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid3</b></dt>
  <dd>A variant of raidz that provides integrated distributed hot spares which
      allows for faster resilvering while retaining the benefits of raidz. A
      dRAID vdev is constructed from multiple internal raidz groups, each with
      <i class="Em" title="Em">D</i> <span class="No">data devices and</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">P</i> <span class="No">parity devices.</span>
      These groups are distributed over all of the children in order to fully
      utilize the available disk performance.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Unlike raidz, dRAID uses a fixed stripe width (padding as necessary with
      zeros) to allow fully sequential resilvering. This fixed stripe width
      significantly effects both usable capacity and IOPS. For example, with the
      default <i class="Em" title="Em">D=8</i> <span class="No">and</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">4kB</i> <span class="No">disk sectors the minimum
      allocation size is</span> <i class="Em" title="Em">32kB</i>. If using
      compression, this relatively large allocation size can reduce the
      effective compression ratio. When using ZFS volumes and dRAID, the default
      of the <b class="Sy" title="Sy">volblocksize</b> property is increased to
      account for the allocation size. If a dRAID pool will hold a significant
      amount of small blocks, it is recommended to also add a mirrored
      <b class="Sy" title="Sy">special</b> vdev to store those blocks.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    In regards to I/O, performance is similar to raidz since for any read all
      <i class="Em" title="Em">D</i> <span class="No">data disks must be
      accessed.</span> Delivered random IOPS can be reasonably approximated as
      <b class="Sy" title="Sy">floor((N-S)/(D+P))*single_drive_IOPS</b>.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    Like raidzm a dRAID can have single-, double-, or triple-parity. The
      <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid1</b>, <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid2</b>,
      and <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid3</b> types can be used to specify the
      parity level. The <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid</b> vdev type is an alias
      for <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid1</b>.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    A dRAID with <i class="Em" title="Em">N</i> <span class="No">disks of
      size</span> <i class="Em" title="Em">X</i>, <i class="Em" title="Em">D</i>
      <span class="No">data disks per redundancy group,</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">P</i> <span class="No">parity level, and</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">S</i> <span class="No">distributed hot spares can
      hold approximately</span> <i class="Em" title="Em">(N-S)*(D/(D+P))*X</i>
      <span class="No">bytes and can withstand</span>
      <i class="Em" title="Em">P</i> devices failing without losing data.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid</b>[<div class="Op"><var class="Ar" title="Ar">parity</var></div>][<div class="Op"><b class="Sy" title="Sy">:</b><var class="Ar" title="Ar">data</var><b class="Sy" title="Sy">d</b></div>][<div class="Op"><b class="Sy" title="Sy">:</b><var class="Ar" title="Ar">children</var><b class="Sy" title="Sy">c</b></div>][<div class="Op"><b class="Sy" title="Sy">:</b><var class="Ar" title="Ar">spares</var><b class="Sy" title="Sy">s</b></div>]</dt>
  <dd>A non-default dRAID configuration can be specified by appending one or
      more of the following optional arguments to the
      <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid</b> keyword:
    <dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
      <dt><var class="Ar" title="Ar">parity</var></dt>
      <dd>The parity level (1-3).</dd>
      <dt><var class="Ar" title="Ar">data</var></dt>
      <dd>The number of data devices per redundancy group. In general, a smaller
          value of <i class="Em" title="Em">D</i> <span class="No">will increase
          IOPS, improve the compression ratio,</span> and speed up resilvering
          at the expense of total usable capacity. Defaults to
          <i class="Em" title="Em">8</i>, <span class="No">unless</span>
          <i class="Em" title="Em">N-P-S</i> <span class="No">is less
          than</span> <i class="Em" title="Em">8</i>.</dd>
      <dt><var class="Ar" title="Ar">children</var></dt>
      <dd>The expected number of children. Useful as a cross-check when listing
          a large number of devices. An error is returned when the provided
          number of children differs.</dd>
      <dt><var class="Ar" title="Ar">spares</var></dt>
      <dd>The number of distributed hot spares. Defaults to zero.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">spare</b></dt>
  <dd>A pseudo-vdev which keeps track of available hot spares for a pool. For
      more information, see the <a class="Sx" title="Sx" href="#Hot_Spares">Hot
      Spares</a> section.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">log</b></dt>
  <dd>A separate intent log device. If more than one log device is specified,
      then writes are load-balanced between devices. Log devices can be
      mirrored. However, raidz vdev types are not supported for the intent log.
      For more information, see the
      <a class="Sx" title="Sx" href="#Intent_Log">Intent Log</a> section.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">dedup</b></dt>
  <dd>A device dedicated solely for deduplication tables. The redundancy of this
      device should match the redundancy of the other normal devices in the
      pool. If more than one dedup device is specified, then allocations are
      load-balanced between those devices.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">special</b></dt>
  <dd>A device dedicated solely for allocating various kinds of internal
      metadata, and optionally small file blocks. The redundancy of this device
      should match the redundancy of the other normal devices in the pool. If
      more than one special device is specified, then allocations are
      load-balanced between those devices.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    For more information on special allocations, see the
      <a class="Sx" title="Sx" href="#Special_Allocation_Class">Special
      Allocation Class</a> section.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">cache</b></dt>
  <dd>A device used to cache storage pool data. A cache device cannot be
      configured as a mirror or raidz group. For more information, see the
      <a class="Sx" title="Sx" href="#Cache_Devices">Cache Devices</a>
    section.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Virtual devices cannot be nested, so a mirror or raidz virtual device can only
  contain files or disks. Mirrors of mirrors (or other combinations) are not
  allowed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A pool can have any number of virtual devices at the top of the configuration
  (known as &#x201C;root vdevs&#x201D;). Data is dynamically distributed across
  all top-level devices to balance data among devices. As new virtual devices
  are added, ZFS automatically places data on the newly available devices.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Virtual devices are specified one at a time on the command line, separated by
  whitespace. Keywords like <b class="Sy" title="Sy">mirror</b>
  <span class="No">and</span> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">raidz</b> are used to
  distinguish where a group ends and another begins. For example, the following
  creates a pool with two root vdevs, each a mirror of two disks:
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">#
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">create</code>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">mypool</var> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">mirror</b>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">sda sdb</var> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">mirror</b>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">sdc sdd</var></code></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Device_Failure_and_Recovery"><a class="permalink" href="#Device_Failure_and_Recovery">Device
  Failure and Recovery</a></h2>
ZFS supports a rich set of mechanisms for handling device failure and data
  corruption. All metadata and data is checksummed, and ZFS automatically
  repairs bad data from a good copy when corruption is detected.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In order to take advantage of these features, a pool must make use of some form
  of redundancy, using either mirrored or raidz groups. While ZFS supports
  running in a non-redundant configuration, where each root vdev is simply a
  disk or file, this is strongly discouraged. A single case of bit corruption
  can render some or all of your data unavailable.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A pool's health status is described by one of three states:
  <b class="Sy" title="Sy">online</b>, <b class="Sy" title="Sy">degraded</b>,
  <span class="No">or</span> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">faulted</b>. An online
  pool has all devices operating normally. A degraded pool is one in which one
  or more devices have failed, but the data is still available due to a
  redundant configuration. A faulted pool has corrupted metadata, or one or more
  faulted devices, and insufficient replicas to continue functioning.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The health of the top-level vdev, such as a mirror or raidz device, is
  potentially impacted by the state of its associated vdevs, or component
  devices. A top-level vdev or component device is in one of the following
  states:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">DEGRADED</b></dt>
  <dd>One or more top-level vdevs is in the degraded state because one or more
      component devices are offline. Sufficient replicas exist to continue
      functioning.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    One or more component devices is in the degraded or faulted state, but
      sufficient replicas exist to continue functioning. The underlying
      conditions are as follows:
    <ul class="Bl-bullet Bl-compact">
      <li>The number of checksum errors exceeds acceptable levels and the device
          is degraded as an indication that something may be wrong. ZFS
          continues to use the device as necessary.</li>
      <li>The number of I/O errors exceeds acceptable levels. The device could
          not be marked as faulted because there are insufficient replicas to
          continue functioning.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">FAULTED</b></dt>
  <dd>One or more top-level vdevs is in the faulted state because one or more
      component devices are offline. Insufficient replicas exist to continue
      functioning.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
    One or more component devices is in the faulted state, and insufficient
      replicas exist to continue functioning. The underlying conditions are as
      follows:
    <ul class="Bl-bullet Bl-compact">
      <li>The device could be opened, but the contents did not match expected
          values.</li>
      <li>The number of I/O errors exceeds acceptable levels and the device is
          faulted to prevent further use of the device.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">OFFLINE</b></dt>
  <dd>The device was explicitly taken offline by the
      <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
      <code class="Cm" title="Cm">offline</code> command.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">ONLINE</b></dt>
  <dd>The device is online and functioning.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">REMOVED</b></dt>
  <dd>The device was physically removed while the system was running. Device
      removal detection is hardware-dependent and may not be supported on all
      platforms.</dd>
  <dt><b class="Sy" title="Sy">UNAVAIL</b></dt>
  <dd>The device could not be opened. If a pool is imported when a device was
      unavailable, then the device will be identified by a unique identifier
      instead of its path since the path was never correct in the first
    place.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Checksum errors represent events where a disk returned data that was expected to
  be correct, but was not. In other words, these are instances of silent data
  corruption. The checksum errors are reported in
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">status</code> and
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">events</code>. When a block is stored redundantly,
  a damaged block may be reconstructed (e.g. from raidz parity or a mirrored
  copy). In this case, ZFS reports the checksum error against the disks that
  contained damaged data. If a block is unable to be reconstructed (e.g. due to
  3 disks being damaged in a raidz2 group), it is not possible to determine
  which disks were silently corrupted. In this case, checksum errors are
  reported for all disks on which the block is stored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a device is removed and later re-attached to the system, ZFS attempts online
  the device automatically. Device attachment detection is hardware-dependent
  and might not be supported on all platforms.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Hot_Spares"><a class="permalink" href="#Hot_Spares">Hot
  Spares</a></h2>
ZFS allows devices to be associated with pools as &#x201C;hot spares&#x201D;.
  These devices are not actively used in the pool, but when an active device
  fails, it is automatically replaced by a hot spare. To create a pool with hot
  spares, specify a <b class="Sy" title="Sy">spare</b> vdev with any number of
  devices. For example,
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">#
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">create</code>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">pool</var> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">mirror</b>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">sda sdb</var> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">spare</b>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">sdc sdd</var></code></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Spares can be shared across multiple pools, and can be added with the
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">add</code> command and removed with the
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">remove</code> command. Once a spare replacement is
  initiated, a new <b class="Sy" title="Sy">spare</b> vdev is created within the
  configuration that will remain there until the original device is replaced. At
  this point, the hot spare becomes available again if another device fails.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a pool has a shared spare that is currently being used, the pool can not be
  exported since other pools may use this shared spare, which may lead to
  potential data corruption.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Shared spares add some risk. If the pools are imported on different hosts, and
  both pools suffer a device failure at the same time, both could attempt to use
  the spare at the same time. This may not be detected, resulting in data
  corruption.
<div class="Pp"></div>
An in-progress spare replacement can be cancelled by detaching the hot spare. If
  the original faulted device is detached, then the hot spare assumes its place
  in the configuration, and is removed from the spare list of all active pools.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The <b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid</b> vdev type provides distributed hot
  spares. These hot spares are named after the dRAID vdev they're a part of
  (<b class="Sy" title="Sy">draid1</b>-<var class="Ar" title="Ar">2</var>-<var class="Ar" title="Ar">3</var>
  <span class="No">specifies spare</span> <var class="Ar" title="Ar">3</var>
  <span class="No">of vdev</span> <var class="Ar" title="Ar">2</var>,
  <span class="No">which is a single parity dRAID</span>) and may only be used
  by that dRAID vdev. Otherwise, they behave the same as normal hot spares.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Spares cannot replace log devices.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Intent_Log"><a class="permalink" href="#Intent_Log">Intent
  Log</a></h2>
The ZFS Intent Log (ZIL) satisfies POSIX requirements for synchronous
  transactions. For instance, databases often require their transactions to be
  on stable storage devices when returning from a system call. NFS and other
  applications can also use <a class="Xr" title="Xr">fsync(2)</a> to ensure data
  stability. By default, the intent log is allocated from blocks within the main
  pool. However, it might be possible to get better performance using separate
  intent log devices such as NVRAM or a dedicated disk. For example:
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">#
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">create</code> <var class="Ar" title="Ar">pool sda
  sdb</var> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">log</b>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">sdc</var></code></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Multiple log devices can also be specified, and they can be mirrored. See the
  <a class="Sx" title="Sx" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a> section for an example
  of mirroring multiple log devices.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Log devices can be added, replaced, attached, detached and removed. In addition,
  log devices are imported and exported as part of the pool that contains them.
  Mirrored devices can be removed by specifying the top-level mirror vdev.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Cache_Devices"><a class="permalink" href="#Cache_Devices">Cache
  Devices</a></h2>
Devices can be added to a storage pool as &#x201C;cache devices&#x201D;. These
  devices provide an additional layer of caching between main memory and disk.
  For read-heavy workloads, where the working set size is much larger than what
  can be cached in main memory, using cache devices allows much more of this
  working set to be served from low latency media. Using cache devices provides
  the greatest performance improvement for random read-workloads of mostly
  static content.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create a pool with cache devices, specify a
  <b class="Sy" title="Sy">cache</b> vdev with any number of devices. For
  example:
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">#
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">create</code> <var class="Ar" title="Ar">pool sda
  sdb</var> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">cache</b> <var class="Ar" title="Ar">sdc
  sdd</var></code></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Cache devices cannot be mirrored or part of a raidz configuration. If a read
  error is encountered on a cache device, that read I/O is reissued to the
  original storage pool device, which might be part of a mirrored or raidz
  configuration.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The content of the cache devices is persistent across reboots and restored
  asynchronously when importing the pool in L2ARC (persistent L2ARC). This can
  be disabled by setting
  <b class="Sy" title="Sy">l2arc_rebuild_enabled</b>=<b class="Sy" title="Sy">0</b>.
  For cache devices smaller than <i class="Em" title="Em">1GB</i>, we do not
  write the metadata structures required for rebuilding the L2ARC in order not
  to waste space. This can be changed with
  <b class="Sy" title="Sy">l2arc_rebuild_blocks_min_l2size</b>. The cache device
  header (<i class="Em" title="Em">512B</i>) is updated even if no metadata
  structures are written. Setting
  <b class="Sy" title="Sy">l2arc_headroom</b>=<b class="Sy" title="Sy">0</b>
  will result in scanning the full-length ARC lists for cacheable content to be
  written in L2ARC (persistent ARC). If a cache device is added with
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">add</code> its label and header will be
  overwritten and its contents are not going to be restored in L2ARC, even if
  the device was previously part of the pool. If a cache device is onlined with
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">online</code> its contents will be restored in
  L2ARC. This is useful in case of memory pressure where the contents of the
  cache device are not fully restored in L2ARC. The user can off- and online the
  cache device when there is less memory pressure in order to fully restore its
  contents to L2ARC.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Pool_checkpoint"><a class="permalink" href="#Pool_checkpoint">Pool
  checkpoint</a></h2>
Before starting critical procedures that include destructive actions (like
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zfs</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">destroy</code>), an administrator can checkpoint
  the pool's state and in the case of a mistake or failure, rewind the entire
  pool back to the checkpoint. Otherwise, the checkpoint can be discarded when
  the procedure has completed successfully.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A pool checkpoint can be thought of as a pool-wide snapshot and should be used
  with care as it contains every part of the pool's state, from properties to
  vdev configuration. Thus, certain operations are not allowed while a pool has
  a checkpoint. Specifically, vdev removal/attach/detach, mirror splitting, and
  changing the pool's GUID. Adding a new vdev is supported, but in the case of a
  rewind it will have to be added again. Finally, users of this feature should
  keep in mind that scrubs in a pool that has a checkpoint do not repair
  checkpointed data.
<div class="Pp"></div>
To create a checkpoint for a pool:
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">#
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">checkpoint</code>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">pool</var></code></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To later rewind to its checkpointed state, you need to first export it and then
  rewind it during import:
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">#
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">export</code>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">pool</var></code></div>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">#
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">import</code>
  <code class="Fl" title="Fl">--rewind-to-checkpoint</code>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">pool</var></code></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
To discard the checkpoint from a pool:
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">#
  <code class="Nm" title="Nm">zpool</code>
  <code class="Cm" title="Cm">checkpoint</code>
  <code class="Fl" title="Fl">-d</code>
  <var class="Ar" title="Ar">pool</var></code></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Dataset reservations (controlled by the <b class="Sy" title="Sy">reservation</b>
  <span class="No">and</span> <b class="Sy" title="Sy">refreservation</b>
  properties) may be unenforceable while a checkpoint exists, because the
  checkpoint is allowed to consume the dataset's reservation. Finally, data that
  is part of the checkpoint but has been freed in the current state of the pool
  won't be scanned during a scrub.
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Special_Allocation_Class"><a class="permalink" href="#Special_Allocation_Class">Special
  Allocation Class</a></h2>
Allocations in the special class are dedicated to specific block types. By
  default this includes all metadata, the indirect blocks of user data, and any
  deduplication tables. The class can also be provisioned to accept small file
  blocks.
<div class="Pp"></div>
A pool must always have at least one normal
  (non-<b class="Sy" title="Sy">dedup</b>/-<b class="Sy" title="Sy">special</b>)
  vdev before other devices can be assigned to the special class. If the
  <b class="Sy" title="Sy">special</b> class becomes full, then allocations
  intended for it will spill back into the normal class.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Deduplication tables can be excluded from the special class by unsetting the
  <b class="Sy" title="Sy">zfs_ddt_data_is_special</b> ZFS module parameter.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Inclusion of small file blocks in the special class is opt-in. Each dataset can
  control the size of small file blocks allowed in the special class by setting
  the <b class="Sy" title="Sy">special_small_blocks</b> property to nonzero. See
  <a href="../7/zfsprops.7.html" class="Xr">zfsprops(7)</a> for more info on this property.</div>
